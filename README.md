## Step 1. Import the car auction sample
1. Open a web browser and go to http://composer-playground.mybluemix.net. Dismiss the welcome

networks:

6. Take a minute to read through the description of the car auction sample, to help understand the
participants, assets and transactions associated with this particular network.

## Step 2. Add Three Participants
In the next section we will now work with the deployed car auction blockchain network.

We will first instantiate three Member participants of the car auction business network:

* Alice Smith (alice@email.com), who will make a bid on a car,
* Bob Jones (bob@email.com), who will also make a bid on a car, and
* Charlie Brown (charlie@email.com), who currently owns a car.

1. Click the **Test** tab and then click on the Member participant registry:

The registry is empty as no members have currently been defined.

2. Click on **Member** to view there are no current members in the environement

3. Click **Create New Participant** to add a new Member.

7. Finally do the same for Charlie. He hasn’t got so much money (he’s selling his car, after all) so let’s give him a starting balance of 100.

8. Verify that all participants in the business network have been correctly defined. Use the appropriate Edit button (![alt text](https://github.com/clingeric/blockchain-tutorial/blob/master/img/16.PNG)) to make any changes.
